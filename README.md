# Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Repository! This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms and practices using Jupyter Notebook. Below is a brief overview of the contents:

## Algorithms

### Linear Regression
- Implementation of Linear Regression algorithm for predicting numerical values based on given input features.

### Multiple Regression
- Extension of Linear Regression to handle multiple input features for predicting numerical values.

### Logistic Regression
- Implementation of Logistic Regression for binary classification problems.

### K-Means Clustering
- Implementation of the K-Means Clustering algorithm for unsupervised clustering of data points.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification and regression tasks.

### Lasso Regression
- Implementation of Lasso Regression for feature selection and regularization.

### Ridge Regression
- Implementation of Ridge Regression for handling multicollinearity in multiple regression problems.

## Data Preprocessing

### Normalization and Standardization
- Examples of data normalization and standardization techniques to preprocess input data for machine learning models.

## Libraries

### NumPy Practice
- Practice files demonstrating the usage of NumPy for numerical computations and array manipulations.

### Pandas Practice
- Practice files showcasing the functionality of Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

## How to Use

Each algorithm or practice file is contained within its respective Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file. You can navigate to the specific directory and find the notebook associated with the algorithm or concept you want to explore.

To run any of the Jupyter Notebook files, make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You can start a Jupyter Notebook server by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a new browser window or tab displaying the Jupyter Notebook dashboard. From there, you can navigate to the specific notebook file and execute the code cells interactively.

## Dependencies

The implementations and practice files may require the following Python libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization, if applicable)

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebook files and use them as a reference for your own machine learning projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy learning and coding! ðŸš€
